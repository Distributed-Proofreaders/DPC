    "text":"most delightful evenings I remember. I had ordered my dinner: \"If you plase,\nsir,\" said the waiter, \"it's not often, this season, we see the like of a sunshine" +
        "like this, and I'd say a walk to the lake and to dhine afther 'ud be your honour's" +
        "choice.\" Whether or not Pat had an end to compass in putting off my dinner," +
        "the advice was very apropos to my regret in leaving the sunshine for indoors, and" +
        "inquiring the direction, I started for the walk. O'Connell has set the fashion of" +
        "\"tails\" in Ireland, and I was accompanied a mile and a half on my way by no less " +
        "nthan thirty men and boys, who relieved guard on either side of me, proffering me" +
        "guidance, horse, boat, minerals, and arbutus toys, with as little heed of reiterated" +
        "denial, refusal, and rebuff as if I had not the slightest right to an opinion on the" +
        "subject. After quite wearying myself out with talking to them, I established a" +
        "small circle of distance between myself and my cortège by swinging my stick, and" +
        "walked on in silent and deaf submission. As I came within sight of Ross Castle" +
        "and the lake, the last four turned back and left me alone; as many as thirty able-*bodied" +
        "men having wasted an hour and a half in this unprofitable persecution. I" +
        "could have employed them better on the Susquehannah." +
        "" +
        "The sun was near setting when I reached Ross Castle, and a soft and golden" +
        "flood of light covered the bosom of the lake, and the background of mountains" +
        "and islands, with a glory inexpressibly beautiful. The side of the ruined castle" +
        "towards me lay in deep shade, and its one square and tall tower cut the glowing" +
        "sky with an effect which made me wish I had been an artist. The scene altogether," +
        "for softness of atmosphere, richness of light, singular beauty of outline, and combination" +
        "of island, mountain, and water, seemed to me quite incomparable. I" +
        "ascended to the top of the ruin, and sat watching the fading light on the lake till" +
        "the colour was dissolved in the twilight; not yet informed of the names of the" +
        "features in the scene, nor caring for the present to know what I looked upon. It" +
        "was a rare moment of natural beauty, sufficient of itself, without legendary or other" +
        "interest. I enjoyed it to the very depths of my heart." +
        "" +
        "The next morning I returned to this same spot. The day was fine, and the view" +
        "looking its best under clear sunshine; but it looked cold after the glowing light in" +
        "which I had seen it the evening before. I was now in the hands of a guide, too," +
        "and obliged to give up my random impressions for information. Ross Castle" +
        "stands on the flat side of the lake, and the road to it is a causeway over a morass," +
        "which is reduced to an isthmus by inlets of the lake on either side. The neighbouring" +
        "ground has been improved and made the site of a cottage ornée by LordKenmare, and the walks and young woods, lawns,
    c. give a delightful air of\nrefinement to the, vicinity. The castle is built on a rock, and the only remains are\nthe large quadrangula, which I ascended the night before, and two flankers in a\nruined state. It is said to have been built by the powerful sept of the O'Donoghoes."};
